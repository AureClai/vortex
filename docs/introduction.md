# Introduction to Vortex

Vortex is a modern frontend web framework for Go, designed to be compiled to WebAssembly (Wasm). It empowers Go developers to build fast, reliable, and interactive user interfaces that run directly in the browser, without writing any JavaScript.

## Core Philosophy

The primary goal of Vortex is to provide a seamless and enjoyable development experience by leveraging the power of Go's type safety, performance, and simplicity.

Key principles include:

-   **Go All the Way:** Write your entire frontend application in Go, from components and state management to styling.
-   **Component-Based Architecture:** Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, making it simple to compose complex UIs.
-   **CSS-in-Go:** A powerful styling solution that allows you to define type-safe, modular, and dynamic styles right next to your components.
-   **High Performance:** By leveraging a Virtual DOM and compiling to WebAssembly, Vortex aims to deliver excellent runtime performance.

## When to use Vortex?

Vortex is an excellent choice if you:

-   Are a Go developer who wants to build web frontends without switching to JavaScript.
-   Want to build highly performant web applications that benefit from WebAssembly's speed.
-   Value type safety and the robustness of a compiled language for your UI code.
-   Are interested in exploring the cutting edge of web development with Go and Wasm.
